# Pedestrian Monitoring & Wi-Fi Prediction

**Performed 2 real-world projects from scratch as a 'Data Analyst' with 'D2I Geelong City' project team for the `City of Greater Geelong, Australia` with affiliation to 'Deakin University'.**

* Project-1: `Pedestrian Monitoring`- Tracked suburb wise foot-count of pedestrians to analyze changes in pre & post lockdown stages using the Wi-Fi dataset across "Hospitals, Libraries, Gyms, Restaurants & Malls" & mapped those locations on google maps using their respective coordinates. 
* Project-2: `Wi-Fi Prediction`- Predicted suburb-wise, daily Wi-Fi usage by Geelong citizen to plan better increase router device bandwidth or router count as per end user usage.
* Implemented Geo-spatial Clustering, handled data imbalance for Multiclass classification (using SMOTE & Down sampling), Boosting & Supervised ML implementation and hyperparameter tuning of Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU & Simple RNN). Also worked on GCP & Tableau for fine tuning of our project.
